    "# Combine agents and vector stores\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers how to combine agents and vector stores. The use case for this is that you've ingested your data into a vector store and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

    "#### 🔍 What I tested and learned:\n",
    "1. Tool Setup and Basic Agent Construction:\n",
    "- I created two tools: one based on a State of the Union QA system and another on Ruff QA (a Python linter).\n",
    "- I configured both tools and used them in a ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent.\n",
    "- This gave me insight into how agents \"think\" through problems, choosing and invoking tools dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Agent Behavior with Compound Questions:\n",
    "- I asked a compound question combining two knowledge areas.\n",
    "- Initially, the agent did try both tools but only returned the second tool’s answer as its final output, skipping part of the question.\n",
    "- This helped me understand the limitation of relying purely on automatic summarization and chaining behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficiency Trade-offs with return_direct=True:\n",
    "- I tested the return_direct=True setting to make the agent act more like a router.\n",
    "- This made the agent faster, stopping once a tool returned a result.\n",
    "- However, it did not work well for multi-hop or compound questions, as it returned only part of the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Improving Results with Prompt Engineering:\n",
    "- I rewrote my question to guide the agent through the reasoning process:\n",
    "“First, find out what tool Ruff uses in Jupyter Notebooks. Then tell me if the president mentioned it in the state of the union.”\n",
    "- This prompt worked perfectly — the agent answered both parts in order and gave a complete response.\n",
    "- It proved that prompt clarity and instruction chaining are key to handling complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Key Takeaways (in my own words):\n",
    "- LangChain agents can be powerful, but they need careful prompt design when dealing with compound logic.\n",
    "- The return_direct setting improves speed and efficiency, but it's best for one-shot questions.\n",
    "- Prompt engineering remains a crucial skill to guide multi-hop reasoning without needing extra architecture.\n",
    "- I now understand the underlying logic flow of LangChain agents better — both in terms of how they select tools and how they summarize outcomes."
